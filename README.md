### Hello I'm Paul (Seungcheol) Oh

I'm currently working as a researcher at WiSE Lab to provide solutions for problems in wireless communications with machine learning. 

### Publications

In keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall
design lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only
to Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration
variables).

Hydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available,
the CSS degrades into a single column layout.

### Projects

Hydeout replaces Hyde's class-based theming with the use
of the following SASS variables:

```scss
$sidebar-bg-color: #202020 !default;
$sidebar-fg-color: white !default;
$sidebar-sticky: true !default;
$layout-reverse: false !default;
$link-color: #268bd2 !default;
```

To override these variables, create your own `assets/css/main.scss` file.
Define your own variables, then import in Hydeout's SCSS, like so:

```scss
---
# Jekyll needs front matter for SCSS files
---

$sidebar-bg-color: #ac4142;
$link-color: #ac4142;
$sidebar-sticky: false;
@import "hydeout";
  your property ID in your config file.

There's also a bunch of minor tweaks and adjustments throughout the
theme. Hope this works for you!
